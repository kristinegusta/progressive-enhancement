### Key things to remember

#### Semantics, SEO, accessibility

When writing html code, ask yourself this question: "What is this series of words : a date ? A title? A paragraph? etc" the answer to that question will tell you which HTML tag to best use to describe the content.

If our pages are not very semantic, Google will not show them, and your sites will not have any traffic (SEO) and  the page will not make much sense to listen to via a Screen Reader.

#### HTML , CSS

```
 <tag attribute="value">content</tag> 
```

Selectors, property, values ! 

Most important - ***Box Model *** and ***Flexbox Model*** , ***positioning*** .

Flexbox’s underlying principle is to make layouts flexible and intuitive.

To accomplish this, it lets containers decide for themselves how to evenly distribute their children — including their size and the space between them.

Default for containers are Display:Block .  Each square thus takes up the full width of its line.

n order to get started with Flexbox, you need to make your container into a flex container with Display: Flex. You can now start to position them within that context, with far less difficulty than traditional CSS.

Use :
- Flex Direction
- Justify Content (main axis)
- Align Items (cross axis)


The flow is the default behavior. You may need an element to exit the position flow.

position : static | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky;

The position property allows you to position an element anywhere (via the top and left properties), from the coordinates of its first parent in position: relative or static.
